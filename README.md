This repository is a collection of instructions and scripts to

- use the Moodle e-learning platform to create user groups for tutorials and teams, and let participants submit assignments using these groups (`setup_files.py`),

- automatically sort the submissions by tutor and teams (`sort_submissions.py`),
- easily enter points and corrections into the grading system (`sort_corrections.py`).
