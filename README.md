This repository is a set of instructions and scripts to

- use the Moodle learning management platform to create user groups for tutorial classes and homework teams, and let participants submit assignments using these groups (`setup_files.py`),
- automatically sort the submissions by tutor and teams (`sort_submissions.py`),
- easily enter points and corrections into the grading system (`sort_corrections.py`).
